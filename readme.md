# Effects of subroutining on code comprehension
**By: Nathan Voldman and Sagiv Yaari**
   
  ## Background:
  Programmers tend to use subroutines for both easier code comprehension and mostly code modularity. In this research we aim to investigate the effect of subroutinning and specifically the naming of subroutines on code comprehension.
    
## Research question:
Our main goal is to understand how splitting the code into subroutines effect the code clarity, specifically how their naming affect the time it takes to understand their functionality
### How does the naming of subroutines effect code clarity?
- Neutral names with no information about functionality (such as: A,B,C, Purple,Red,Green)
-  Short functional names (with partial information about functionality) - This is very common in coding
-  Long descriptive names (full function can be deduced from name)
    

##  Methodology:
  
We will test code comprehension by introducing the subjects with code that functions close to a normal code with nested functions. The functions will have either non informative names (e.g. “A”, “B”, “C”), partially informative names (e.g. “weird addition”, “weird multiplication”, “weird power”) or total information names (e.g. “add_plus_one”, “multiply_plus_one”, “power_plus_one”). The subject will be requested to predict the output of certain input and the time taken to answer (as long as the answer was correct) will be measured. We will create 3 of these types of functions and randomize the naming between subjects. We will create one baseline function with either fully informative or neutral names to standardize between subjects.
