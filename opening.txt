Greetings!

First of all, we want to thank you for taking the time to participate in this study where we hope to better understand how developers work and help all of us write better code.

In the following screens you will be presented with a short code, input to the main function and possible outputs. We ask you to read the code, try to understand it and finally choose what you think the code should output. First you'll be presented with an easy question to get you going followed by 3 harder questions. we ask you to try and get the right answer as fast as you can.

Finally, the estimated time to complete this study is about 8 minutes, and for it to be significant we ask that you take breaks only between questions. 

## add a line about the code being straight forward and there is no bugs
## Recommend having a pencil and a piece of paper although they are discourage from actually interpreting line by line but sometimes it helps to understand the functionality of each part

## add assurance we don't collect any identifying data
## add the possibility that you can stop any time
## checkbox that says "I read and I agree to participate in the study"
